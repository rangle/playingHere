### Project Setup

First, make sure to clone this repository, and once you've done that, inside the project folder, to install all the modules: 
```
npm install
```

Once you have everything installed, you can run on of two commands in the terminal.

For Development (which for now, is all we need)

```
npm run dev
```

which runs the webpack-dev-server with a bunch of flags.

For Production

```
npm run build
```

However, not sure if it's going to be working yet - we can work on this later.
